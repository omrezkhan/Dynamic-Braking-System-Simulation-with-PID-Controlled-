# Dynamic Braking System Simulation with PID-Controlled ABS

## Description
This project simulates a 4-wheel braking system with PID-based ABS control using MATLAB and Simulink. It captures wheel slip, angular acceleration, and dynamic load transfer for realistic vehicle response under different conditions.

## Files
- `ABS_MAtlab_Script_Automation.m` – MATLAB script to initialize and configure the simulation.  
- `Simulink_ABS_Braking_Vehicle_Dynamics.slx` – Simulink model of the ABS braking system.  

## Instructions
1. **First**, run the MATLAB script `ABS_MAtlab_Script_Automation.m`.  
2. **Then**, open and run the Simulink model `Simulink_ABS_Braking_Vehicle_Dynamics.slx` to view the simulation results.  

## Requirements
- MATLAB  
- Simulink  

## Key Features
- PID-controlled ABS to prevent wheel lockup  
- Realistic 4-wheel braking dynamics  
- Monitors tire friction to maintain stability
